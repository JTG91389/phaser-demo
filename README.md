# What is this for?

First time playing with [phaser3](https://phaser.io/) using this tutorial on [shakuro](https://shakuro.com/blog/phaser-js-a-step-by-step-tutorial-on-making-a-phaser-3-game)

Let's make tile maps [here](https://www.mapeditor.org/)

## What to try next

-Add two types of enemies, that will attack each other and the player
-Add health item to pick up to gain health
-Calculate final score as a function of regular score plus health points
-Allow one enemy to shoot projectiles(maybe animate projectiles)
-When you pickup a chest, does pokemon like battle sequence to allow you to play small gravity mini game, chest score is the same as minigame score
-Build small gravity minigame

## Gravity mini game

this will be a simple mini game where you and an AI are to move your avatar around a field and the more particles you collect within a set time span the more points you game from the chest mini game

Your avatar will suck up particles in a gravity like manner
